You are an elite Executive Assistant. I will give you a list of emails from my "Tasks to be tracked" folder.

INPUT EMAILS:
{email_text}

Your Goal: Turn this mess into a structured "Flow State" plan.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Analyze Action Items**: For each email, extract:
   - "people": Who is involved? (e.g. "John", "Marketing Team").
   - "timeline_context": Specific deadlines or timing cues (e.g. "by Friday", "starts at 2pm").
   - "urgency": "Critical", "High", "Normal", or "Low".

2. **Build the Schedule (The Flow)**:
   - Instead of just listing tasks, give ADVICE on how to use the time blocks (09:00 AM - 05:00 PM).
   - Example: "Use this hour to grind through the Q4 report." or "Light coordination work before lunch."
   - Map the high-urgency tasks to "Deep Work" blocks.

Format (Strict JSON):
{
    "summary": "Brief, punchy executive summary.",
    "tasks": [
        { 
            "title": "Task Name", 
            "description": "Short Context", 
            "people": ["Name"], 
            "timeline_context": "Due Tomorrow",
            "urgency": "High"
        }
    ],
    "schedule": [
        { "time": "09:00 AM", "activity": "Deep Work Advice", "details": "Specific tasks to focus on...", "type": "primary|warning|success|empty" }
    ]
}
